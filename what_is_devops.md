* Source Code Management (git)
* Continuous Integration (jenkins)
* Continuous Delivery (jenkins)
* Virtualization
* Configuration Management (ansible, puppet, chef, terraform)
* Containerization (Docker)
* Cloud Computing (AWS, Azure, Google Cloud Platform)

* Final Project
* DevOps for 2020 (new tools / topics in the DevOps pipeline)
 

## What is DevOps

Development + Operations

### What **IS NOT** DevOps

- A technology
- A tool
- A software
- A programming language
- A team 
- _** No wrong definition actually_ :)
 

### Software Development in the 1990's

Programmers would write software (mainly in c and c++) and then manually share it with users on servers.
Users would download that software and manually install it on their computers.
People that wrote the software were generally separated from the people that maintained the servers for running the software on.
Bringing software to market was a long, arduous task filled with complicated and error prone steps, resulting in a long development life-cycle

From Wikipedia:

> DevOps is a set of practices that combines software development and information-technology operations which aims to shorten the systems development life cycle and provide to shorten the systems development cycle and provide continuous delivery with high software quality.

The introduction of the DevOps practice brought about a merging of the Development Team and the Operations Team into a "hybrid" called "DevOps".

# 1 + 1 = 3

Working together, these teams create a **synergy** that makes working in a software company a pleasure rather than a stressful ordeal.

Negative points from this process:

Manually creating software and manually installing software;

Lots of human errors in the process.

Separating the process of bringing software to market into two isolated teams tends to create animosity and "its your fault not mine" type of behaviour.

Software takes a long time to be delivered and another company that is faster and better will drive you out of the market.

3) Python
4) Docker
5) Jenkins 
6) Ansible
